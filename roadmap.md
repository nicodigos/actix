Here's a reordered list of what to learn next after creating a basic Actix Web "Hello World" application, arranged by increasing complexity and logical progression:

1. *Routing and HTTP Methods*:
   - Learn about defining more complex routes, handling different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and managing route parameters.

2. *Request Handling*:
   - Explore how to handle and parse request data, including query parameters and request bodies.

3. *Asynchronous Programming*:
   - Deepen your understanding of async programming in Rust, including async/await patterns and how they integrate with Actix Web.

4. *Middleware*:
   - Study how to apply middleware for tasks like logging, authentication, and request modification.

5. *Error Handling*:
   - Learn how to handle errors gracefully, including custom error responses and error handling middleware.

6. *Database Integration*:
   - Understand how to integrate a database using libraries like diesel or sqlx, and manage database connections.

7. *Testing*:
   - Investigate how to write unit tests and integration tests for your Actix Web application to ensure robustness and reliability.

8. *Authentication and Authorization*:
   - Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as JWT or OAuth, to secure your application.

9. *Configuration and Environment Management*:
   - Learn how to manage configuration settings using environment variables or configuration files.

10. *Deployment*:
    - Explore strategies for deploying your Actix Web application to production environments, including containerization with Docker and cloud deployment options.

11. *Documentation*:
    - Study how to generate and serve API documentation, similar to Swagger UI or ReDoc, using tools like paperclip or utoipa.

This progression ensures you build on foundational knowledge before tackling more advanced concepts.
